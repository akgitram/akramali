        <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify">On this mild, sunny afternoon along the Front Range, I elected to sit outdoors and enjoy the pleasant weather; after all, snow is expected to arrive overnight.  Soon after settling in my chair, I heard the raucous call of a common raven and scanned the sky to locate its source.
But I initially caught sight of a pair of red-tailed hawks, lazily circling above our Littleton farm.  Their peaceful flight was soon disrupted by the raven and his partner, both of which started dive-bombing the buteos.  Whatever the reason for their attack, the more agile ravens had a distinct advantage; they initially harassed both red-tails but eventually settled on one.  As the freed hawk escaped to the north, the unlucky victim and his tormenters drifted to the south, soon disappearing behind a grove of trees.</p>

        <p class="lead"  style="text-align: justify">Today, a powerful volcanic eruption in the Tonga archipelago set off tsunami advisories across the Pacific Ocean, including the West Coast of the U.S.  As I write this blog, it is too early to know if any effects will be observed in our country.

The islands of Tonga, numbering 170, lie in the southwest Pacific Ocean and are grouped in two parallel chains that trend north to south.  The chains are divided by the Tonga Trench, where the Pacific Plate is dipping beneath the Australian Plate.  Islands of the western chain are the product of subduction volcanism; the leading edge of the subducting Pacific Plate melts as it approaches the mantle, igniting the volcanoes that form the western chain.  This morning's eruption was of a volcano that had not yet risen above sea level (it had not yet produced a visible island).</p>
